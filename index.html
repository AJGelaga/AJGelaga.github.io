                My favorite subject is CMSC 22 because the concepts there
                are closest to the industry I want to join.

                ETHICS 1 definitely helped shape me into a more introspective
                person, and showed me the terrible and beautiful parts of us.

                Java/C# are my favorite languages because they were tailor-made

                I love debate, it's what got me thinking outside of just living for the sake 
                of existing. Besides that, I generally write poems and essays about things, and read
                opinion articles and novels. Also, I love playing video games, particularly ones
                that deal with philosophical concepts.
